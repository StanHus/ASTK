# AgentSprint TestKit (ASTK)

Below is a formal **Statement of Work (SoW)** and a detailed, technically-oriented implementation plan for **AgentSprint TestKit (ASTK)**—a CI-first behavioural-coverage and regression-gating framework that lets Trilogy’s engineers ship brand-new agents with confidence in <15 minutes.

---

## Executive summary

ASTK’s pipeline ingests an agent artefact (Docker image or Python entry-point) plus a declarative *Scenario-as-Code* file, auto-synthesises diverse user dialogues, fuzzes safety edges, computes reference-free quality scores, traces every tool call with OpenTelemetry, and produces a binary **ship/no-ship verdict** accompanied by dashboards and diff reports.  Nothing in Trilogy’s existing research stack provides PR-time gating, synthetic-persona stress tests or protocol-level chaos injections—making ASTK a net-new capability and a force-multiplier for the CoE’s “build fast, publish faster” mandate.

## 1 Statement of Work

### 1.1 Purpose

Design, implement and open-source **AgentSprint TestKit** to:

1. **Automate behavioural validation** of any LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI or custom agent at pull-request time.
2. **Prevent silent regressions** via semantic diffing against the current production baseline.
3. **Enforce safety & policy constraints** with red-team fuzzing and hallucination detectors.
4. **Expose coverage, latency & cost telemetry** through OpenLLMetry spans that feed existing Comet/Grafana stacks. ([GitHub](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 1.2 Scope

- **In scope** – scenario-DSL, synthetic-persona generator, diff & coverage scorers, garak safety probes, chaos/fault injectors, OTel export, GitHub-Actions template, docs and demo repos.
- **Out of scope** – production hosting of agents, downstream business logic, UI design beyond dashboards.

### 1.3 Success criteria

- <10 min median CI run over 200 synthetic conversations.
- ≥90 % scenario branch-coverage reported.
- Semantic diff must flag ≥95 % of purposeful quality regressions introduced during test seeding.
- Public GitHub repo with Apache-2.0 licence and >250 stars within 90 days post-launch.

### 3.2 Architectural components

1. **Runner** – async orchestrator launches agent container, feeds scenarios, captures traces.
2. **Scenario store** – versioned YAML in repo; option for S3 cache.
3. **Persona synthesiser** – DeepEval API + GPT-4o backend for persona prompts.
4. **Metric plugins** – G-Eval, SelfCheckGPT, latency, cost, success-rate, noise-sensitivity.
5. **Tracer** – OpenLLMetry + OTLP exporter; tags spans with `agent.id`, `scenario.id`, `persona.id`.
6. **Chaos layer** – garak probes + internal “agent-monkey” fault injector.
7. **CI bridge** – GitHub Action container; writes JUnit-XML & Markdown summary for PR checks.

## 4 Technical approach (deep dive)

### 4.1 Scenario-as-Code DSL

```yaml
task: "file_qna"
persona:
  archetype: "impatient_mobile_user"
  temperature: 0.9
protocol: "A2A"
success:
  regex: "(?i)here's"
budgets:
  latency_ms: 3000
chaos:
  - "drop_tool:search"
  - "inject_latency:1500"

```

*Schema validated by `pydantic` for runtime safety.*

### 4.2 Synthetic-persona generation

- Calls `deepeval.Synthesizer.generate(n=50, persona="...")` to emit diversified chat pairs. ([Confident AI Docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/tutorials/tutorial-dataset-synthesis?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Augments with *PersonaFuse* augmentation from recent 1 B-persona paper to widen edge cases. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20094?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4.3 Metric pipeline

- **Quality** – G-Eval-style CoT + rubric prompts; reference-free summarisation evaluator. ([OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/how_to_eval_abstractive_summarization?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Hallucination** – SelfCheckGPT sampling divergence score. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Task success** – AgentBench env wrappers for structured tasks. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03688?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Diff** – paired-run bootstrap t-test; flag if Δquality > 5 % or p < 0.05.

### 4.4 Coverage tracing

- Instrument agent calls via OpenLLMetry middleware; emit spans per tool-call, protocol exchange, memory access. ([GitHub](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Aggregate with Langfuse conventions for latency & cost; push to Grafana. ([Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/faq/all/llm-observability?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4.5 Safety & chaos probes

- garak modules: `jailbreak`, `vuln-disclosure`, `self-harm`. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.11036v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Internal fault injector: random 503s, tool JSON schema mis-matches, MCP malformed messages.
- Fault-oracle scorer downgrades quality if agent fails graceful-degradation heuristic.

---

## 5 Acceptance criteria

1. **CI gate** rejects PR when any of:
    - Quality-Δ < -5 %
    - Hallucination score > threshold
    - Coverage < 80 % skills/tools edges
    - Latency budget exceeded
    - Safety probe success ≥ 1
2. All tracer spans visible in Comet OTLP endpoint within 60 s of run.
3. 100 % unit-test coverage of core DSL and metric modules; fuzz tests for chaos layer.
4. Benchmarked throughput: 500 conversations/min on a single A10G GPU runner.

---

## 6 Key assumptions

- OpenAI, Anthropic, or OSS LLM API tokens are available for test execution.
- Agents expose a gRPC/HTTP or CLI interface compatible with ASTK runner.
- CI runners have Docker-in-Docker or Kubernetes privileges for container launch.
- CoE teams accept Apache-2.0 licence and contribute back under same terms.

## 7 Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API rate-limits inflate CI time | Medium | Parallel batch with adaptive back-off; cache embeddings locally. |
| Rapid agent-framework churn | High | Thin adapters; version-pin matrix tested nightly. |
| False-positive safety blocks | Medium | Provide bypass label `ci-override/astk`; auto-open JIRA for triage. |
| GPU scarcity in CI | Low | Fallback to CPU + smaller models for smoke runs; nightly “full” tier. |

---

## 8 Ownership & communication

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **VP AI CoE** (you) | Architecture, core code, releases, public comms. |
| CoE Engineer (0.25 FTE) | Dashboard wiring, Grafana infra, test data curation. |
| Security liaison | Review garak findings, update probe pack monthly. |
| DevOps shared services | Maintain self-hosted GPU runners, secrets store. |

*Weekly* Loom stand-ups; *bi-weekly* Substack “lab-note” progress posts; *monthly* internal demo.

### Conclusion

AgentSprint TestKit will give Trilogy a first-of-its-kind **CI safety net** for hyper-fast agent shipping—perfectly aligned with the CoE’s ethos yet covering a net-new problem space.  By week 12 you will have: a hardened open-source package, turnkey CI integration, executive-friendly dashboards, and a new stream of thought-leadership content to propel follower growth.
