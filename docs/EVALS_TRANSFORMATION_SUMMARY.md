# 🚀 ASTK Transformation: OpenAI Evals Integration

## 🌟 The Vision

**From Basic Testing → Professional Evaluation Platform**

OpenAI's new Evals API represents exactly what ASTK needs to become: a professional-grade agent evaluation platform. This integration transforms ASTK from a simple benchmarking tool into an industry-leading evaluation solution.

## 🔥 What This Changes

### Before: ASTK v0.1.3 (Current)

```python
# Basic pattern matching
success_criteria = {
    "regex": "(?i)here's",
    "semantic_score": 0.8
}

# Manual evaluation
result = "PASS" if regex.match(response) else "FAIL"
```

### After: ASTK v0.2.0 (With Evals)

```python
# AI-powered professional evaluation
evaluation = {
    "type": "score_model",
    "model": "o3",
    "grader_prompt": expert_grader_prompt,
    "range": [1, 10],
    "dimensions": ["accuracy", "completeness", "clarity", "usefulness"]
}

# Detailed scoring with explanations
result = {
    "steps": [
        {"description": "Technical accuracy assessment", "result": "8.0"},
        {"description": "Completeness evaluation", "result": "7.5"},
        {"description": "Clarity assessment", "result": "8.5"},
        {"description": "Practical value review", "result": "7.0"}
    ],
    "result": "7.8"
}
```
