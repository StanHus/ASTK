      "output": "Agent: The project is called AgentSprint TestKit (ASTK), which is a CI-first behavioral-coverage and regression-gating framework designed to help engineers confidently ship new AI agents in less than 15 minutes. Here are some key features of ASTK:\n\n- Fast CI Integration: Median CI run time is less than 10 minutes over 200 synthetic conversations.\n- Synthetic Personas: Automatically generates diverse user dialogues to stress test agents.\n- Comprehensive Coverage: Provides greater than 90% scenario branch-coverage reporting.\n- Safety First: Includes red-team fuzzing and hallucination detection for safety.\n- Rich Telemetry: Integrates with OpenTelemetry to provide coverage, latency, and cost metrics.\n- Regression Prevention: Performs semantic diffing against production baseline to prevent regressions.\n- Chaos Engineering: Enables protocol-level fault injection and edge case testing.\n\nTo use ASTK, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install ASTK using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install astk\n```\n\n2. Add ASTK to your CI pipeline by creating a workflow file (e.g., `astk-ci.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory with the provided configuration.\n\n3. Define test scenarios in a YAML file (e.g., `scenarios.yaml`) where you specify the task, persona, protocol, success criteria, budgets, and chaos engineering settings.\n\nFor detailed documentation, visit [docs.astk.dev](https://docs.astk.dev). Contributions to the project are welcome, and you can find more details in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). The project is licensed under Apache-2.0.\n",
