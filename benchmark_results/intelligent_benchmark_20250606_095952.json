It allows you to evaluate the performance, intelligence, and capabilities of AI agents through diverse scenarios such as file analysis, code comprehension, and complex reasoning.\n\n### How to Use:\n1. **Installation**:\n   - Install from PyPI:\n     ```bash\n     pip install agent-sprint-testkit\n     ```\n   \n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   ```bash\n   astk --help\n   ```\n\n3. **Set API Key**:\n   ```bash\n   export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Initialize a Project**:\n   ```bash\n   astk init my-agent-tests\n   cd my-agent-tests\n   ```\n\n5. **Run Your First Benchmark**:\n   - Benchmark an example agent:\n     ```bash\n     astk benchmark examples/agents/file_qa_agent.py\n     ```\n   - Or run directly from your project:\n     ```bash\n     python scripts/simple_benchmark.py examples/agents/file_qa_agent.py\n     ```\n\n### Available Tools:\n- **ASTK CLI (Primary Interface)**:\n  - Initialize project, run benchmarks, generate reports, view usage examples.\n- **Legacy Script Runners**:\n  - Direct benchmark execution, basic agent runner.\n\n### Project Structure:\nThe project structure includes directories for examples, scripts, core framework, benchmark results, configuration files, and documentation.\n\n### Performance Tips:\n- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for faster responses.\n- Use GPT-4 for better intelligence in complex reasoning tasks.\n- Monitor token usage in results for cost optimization.\n\n### Contributing:\n1. Create new agents in `examples/agents/`.\n2. Add benchmark scenarios in `scripts/simple_benchmark.py`.\n3. Test with: `python scripts/simple_benchmark.py your_agent.py`.\n\n### License:\nApache 2.0 License - See LICENSE file for details.\n\nTo get started with benchmarking your AI agents, follow these commands:\n```bash\npip install agent-sprint-testkit\nastk benchmark examples/agents/file_qa_agent.py\n```\n\nFor a quick start, use these commands:\n```bash\npip install agent-sprint-testkit\nastk init my-tests\nastk examples\n```\n",
