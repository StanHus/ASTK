Path Traversal: Lack of input validation can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities where an attacker manipulates file paths to access unauthorized directories or files.\n\n3. Insecure File Permissions: Files created by the application may have insecure permissions, allowing unauthorized access or modification by attackers.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the following fixes can be implemented:\n\n1. Validate File Paths: Ensure that user inputs for file paths are validated to prevent arbitrary file reading. Restrict file access to a specific directory if possible.\n\n2. Prevent Path Traversal: Use secure file path handling functions to prevent path traversal attacks. Check if the requested file path is within an allowed directory.\n\n3. Set Secure File Permissions: When creating files, ensure that proper permissions are set to prevent unauthorized access. Only allow read/write access where necessary.\n\nNow, I will provide code examples to demonstrate how these fixes can be implemented in the codebase.\nLet's first address the arbitrary file reading vulnerability by validating user input for file paths.
