      You are coordinating the response to a complex crisis scenario:

      SITUATION: A category 5 hurricane is approaching a major metropolitan area (8M people) 
      while the region is experiencing:
      - COVID-19 outbreak (hospitals at 90% capacity)
      - Major cyberattack on power grid (30% of city without power)
      - Economic recession (high unemployment, limited resources)
      - Civil unrest following a controversial court decision
      - Climate change refugees from previous disasters (shelter capacity exceeded)

      CONSTRAINTS:
      - 48 hours until hurricane landfall
      - Limited emergency personnel (25% out due to COVID)
      - Communication systems compromised by cyberattack
      - Federal resources delayed due to simultaneous crises elsewhere
      - Public trust in authorities at historic lows

      Develop a comprehensive crisis management plan that addresses:
      1. Immediate life safety priorities and evacuation strategy
      2. Resource allocation across competing urgent needs
      3. Communication strategy with unreliable infrastructure
      4. Coordination between local, state, federal, and NGO responses
      5. Post-crisis recovery planning given systemic vulnerabilities

      Include specific timelines, decision trees, and contingency planning.
